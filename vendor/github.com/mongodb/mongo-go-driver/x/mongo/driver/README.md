MongoDB Go Driver Low-Level Driver Library
==========================================
The packages within this library allow users to build applications using a low-level driver
interface. Knowledge of the internals of a MongoDB driver are assumed, so this library contains
advanced features. The aim of this library is to provide an easy to use, high performance
implementation of a low-level driver.

This Library's API is experimental and subject to change. Packages may be changed or removed without
notice. These APIs are not stable and do not guarantee backward compatibility.
