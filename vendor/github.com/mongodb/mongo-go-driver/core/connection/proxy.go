// MongoDB server and proxy the traffic between connections it is given and the
// server. It will pass each of the wireops it reads from the handled connection
// to a Processor. If an error is returned from the processor, the wireop will
// not be forwarded onto the server. If there is not an error the returned message
// will be passed onto the server. If both the return message and the error are nil,
// the original wiremessage will be passed onto the server.
