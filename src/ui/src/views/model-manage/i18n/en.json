If there is sensitive enterprise data (such as employee name, job title, etc.) in the model, please desensitize it before exporting to avoid leaking sensitive information;\n4. When the model group is in import process, it will search for the group name that matches the same ID in the target environment. If it does not exist, you can choose to create a new one or place it in Uncategorized group;\n5. In order to avoid leakage of user information, the exported data will not contain information about the creator or modifier of the data in the local environment;\n6. In order to avoid the conflict of model data being tampered by multiple parties at the same time, only one imported task is allowed to exist at the same time;\n7. Due to the logical protection of the CMDB's own functions, the built-in model of CMDB is not allowed to be imported or exported, please be aware.",
