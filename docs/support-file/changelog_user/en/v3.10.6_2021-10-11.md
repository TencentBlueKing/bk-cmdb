# [CMDB] v3.10.6 version update - 2021-10-11

## New

- [New] New version of full-text search upgrade, please read the [Guidelines](https://github.com/TencentBlueKing/bk-cmdb/issues/5507)
- [New] Business topology adjustment, need to delete cache data after upgrading this version, please read issue [#5471](https://github.com/TencentBlueKing/bk-cmdb/issues/5471) for details)
- [New] Attribute authentication feature, please note the version dependency: IAM SaaS` >= 1.4.15`, IAM Backend` >= 1.7.7`. This version involves the migration of stock model instance permissions, if there are more permissions the process of executing init_db for permission migration may last for some time, it is recommended to avoid executing permission application and instance operation during the process of permission migration.
- [New] New interface for cleaning audit logs (see issue[#5603](https://github.com/TencentBlueKing/bk-cmdb/issues/5603) for how to use the interface)
- [New] Business support for cross-page batch editing
- [New] Archive service provides "delete completely" capability

## Fix

- [Fix] Fix the problem that the new instance fails to obtain lock twice when the new instance is self-associated.
- [Fix] Fix the problem of topo creation caused by using the host/service instance count interface.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of confusing query mode switching when querying the model instance of resource directory.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the model relationship can still be created by repeatedly clicking the create button when creating a new level.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of loading when model instance details are wrong.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the deletion history of other instances is loaded when viewing the deletion history of single instance model.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of displaying no authority due to abnormal data on operation statistics page.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the synchronization status of cluster template sets the synchronizer as the current user.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the mainline model event cannot be found in redis after going to db to check the details.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of panic in the transfer scenario for a large number of hosts (the number of hosts is more than 500 and the number of process templates in the service template is more than 10)
- [Fix] Checking problem when handling dynamic grouping and field type is organization
- [Fix] When exporting host data, adjust the processing of module and set data if there is no custom hierarchy
- [Fix] Repair the problem of querying host deletion history bk_obj_id parameter
- [Fix] Repair the problem of error when adding hosts in the module to create service instances with template without process
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the chart of operation statistics instance is not displayed.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that only the first one is authenticated in the list when dynamic group editing and deletion are authenticated.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of incomplete display of topology data of self-associated model.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that the hosts in the module cannot be transferred to the idle machine when no service instance is available.
- [Fix] Repair the problem that service instances cannot be cloned to other hosts due to incorrect acquisition of process data.
- [Fix] Repair the problem of setting id to 0 when importing model attributes.
- [Fix] Fix the judgment condition of mainline model, not using business topology grouping as judgment condition, so that the common model under this group can be synchronized to IAM normally.
- [Fix] upgrade to add upgrade operation of skipping unregistered actions
- [Fix] Fix the problem that dynamic grouping cannot be queried under audit.
- [Fix] Fix the problem of generic model instance authentication
- [Fix] Fix the error caused by transaction commit failure when synchronizing cluster template instances
- [Fix] Host search problem that cannot be searched by entering \ character

## Optimization

- [Optimize] Support fuzzy search for host character field
- [Optimize] Query cluster template synchronization status compatible with no module under the cluster
- [Optimize] Support fuzzy search for business name search by default
- [Optimize] taskserver clears redundant tasks from one month ago
- [Optimize] Generic model built-in field names are unified to unmodifiable
- [Optimize] Change business name search from case sensitive to case insensitive
